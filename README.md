The following tables were used:

## HD2018

Institution Directory. This table contains directory information for every institution in the 2017 IPEDS universe.  Includes name, address, city, state, zip code and various URL links to the institution's home page, admissions, financial aid offices and  the net price calculator.  Identifies institutions as currently active, institutions that participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs for which IPEDS is mandatory.  It also includes variables derived from the 2017-18 Institutional Characteristics survey, such as control and level of institution, highest level and highest degree offered and Carnegie classifications.

## DRVEF2018

Frequently used derived variables (EF): Fall enrollment 2018. Table includes total full- and part-time enrollment: number of students by student level; percent of students by race/ethnicity categories for all students, undergraduate students and graduate students; percent of students enrolled in distance education courses; percent of undergraduate students by age groups; number of adult age (25-64) that are enrolled by level of student; percent of first-time students that are in-state, out-of-state, or from foreign countries;  Frequently used derived variables may include data for child campuses derived from allocation factors that are reported by the parent institution. Parent/child indicators can be found in table FLAGS2018.

## S2018_IS

Full-time instructional staff, by faculty and tenure status, academic rank, race/ethnicity, and gender (Degree-granting institutions): Fall 2018.This table contains the number of full-time instructional staff on the payroll of the institution as of November 1,  by faculty and tenure status, academic rank, race/ethnicity and gender. This file has multiple records per institution.  Each record is uniquely defined by the variables IPEDS ID (UNITID), and the variable SISCAT which is the combination of faculty and tenure status FACSTAT (tenured, on tenure track, and not on-tenure track/no tenure system) and academic rank ARANK  (professors, associate professors, etc.) . Staff that are not on tenure track are further disaggregated by contract length (multi-year, indefinite, annual and less-than-annual). The multi-year and indefinite contracts began in 2016. From 2012 through 2015 the multi-year and indefinite contract lengths were combined as one category and often referred to as multi-year in past documentation. These data are applicable to degree-granting institutions with 15 or more full-time employees and related administrative offices.  Prior to the IPEDS Web-based data collection in 2001, human resource data reported by race/ethnicity and gender was only available in odd-numbered years.  Beginning with 2001, human resource data reported by race/ethnicity and gender was mandatory in odd-numbered years and optional in even-numbered years.  Beginning with 2016 reporting human resource data by race/ethnicity and gender is mandatory annually.

## Metadata Tables:

Tables18 – This table lists each data table in the database by survey component. It includes table name, table title, brief description, and data year covered. It also identifies the data release (i.e., final data that has revised the provisional data or provisional, which has yet to be revised) and the date the table was released in the IPEDS “Use the data” website.

vartable18 – This variable table lists each variable in the data table by survey component. It includes variable names, descriptions, source, data types and formats. Also, vartable18 identifies variables that were subject to revisions.

valuesets18 – This table lists the value labels of each categorical variable in the database. 

MetaDataDefinitions – This table describes each variable found in the metadata tables (i.e., Tables18, vartable18, and valuesets18).
